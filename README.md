# ASCII2Binary
This is an ASCII To Binary Converter. I developed a terminal and a GUI one.

ascii2bin.py refers to the terminal script and ascii2binTK.py refers to the GUI script (Using Tkinter).

Terminal one:
- The script will start and display a greet message, after retrieving your username on the computer.
- Then it will ask for your input on the piece of text that you want to convert (there is no character limit).
- It will display what you entered
- It will convert the text and display it in binary code in the terminal

GUI one:
- After running it, a small window will be displayed
- You have to write the text in the entry bar
- After clicking "convert", the converted code will display in the window and it will be automatically copied to your clipboard
- You can then convert other pieces of text simply by changing the text in the entry bar
